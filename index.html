        Rev Collective is a peer-to-peer mentorship and accountability group for women and nonbinary people. Often these groups experience implicit bias, which impedes their paychecks, status, and the opportunities and connections that come their way. Rev Collective counters that by creating a space to share obstacles and ideate ways to gracefully overcome.

      <h2>Imposter Syndrome <br />(The Workbook)</h2>

      <h3 class="italic">
        This workbook is for people who feel held back by their Imposter Syndrome (persistent, pervasive self-doubt, even in the face of successes).
      </h3>
      <p>
        This book is a practical, interactive guide for those struggling with Imposter Syndrome. It offers ways to head off the downward spiral of self-doubt and reframe your mindset. It’s for anyone who doesn’t believe in their own intelligence, skill and self-worth. Do you know anyone like that?
