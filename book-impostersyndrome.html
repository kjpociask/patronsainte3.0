        10 Signs You Have Imposter Syndrome
      </h4>
      <ol>
        <li>You "bluffed your way" into or through a job.</li>
        <li>Most of the things you've attained were through "sheer dumb luck." </li>
        <li>You happened to be "in the right place at the right time."</li>
        <li>So far no one seems to have noticed that you are less talented or smart than people think you are. </li>
        <li>When others give you praise, you ignore it because they are just being nice or trying to flatter you.</li>
        <li>You discount compliments because people don't know the real you or the whole story.</li>
        <li>Your successes are not as big a deal as they seem from the outside.</li>
        <li>You wouldn't have gotten anywhere without your mentors.</li>
        <li>Your wins are largely due to your teammates, and you happen to be reaping the credit.</li>
        <li>You sometimes feel like a misfit in your profession or career and you should have done something else.</li>
