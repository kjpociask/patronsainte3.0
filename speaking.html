      This talk is about imposter syndrome, shame and doubt. Imposter Syndrome is when you feel you got everything you have through luck, chance and coincidence and not due to your own abilities. More people have it than they'd like to think. If this talk rings true, leave a comment so we all know we're not alone.

     Envy could use a little destigmatization. Envy is simply the result of recognizing your goals and dreams elsewhere, coming to fruition for someone else. Envy can light a fire under you like nothing else. The only catch is to know which kind of envy to ignore and which to pay attention to.

       There's no reason to do solopreneurship alone, alpha females. Form a wolfpack instead. This was a hands-on workshop on the importance of accountability meetings, and tips on running them. Six female entrepreneurs who meet up once a month, taught others how to hold each other accountable to their goals, inspire and 'unstick' each other.
